# Intro

I'm a Singaporean-born, Beijing bred tech marketer currently working in Manila/Singapore.
I currently have two roles as both the Head of ShopeePay Philippines and the Head of Marketing 
for Shopee Philippines.


# History and current events

I was born in hot and humid Singapore at Mt. Elizabeth Hospital on Dec. 30th, 1991.

I moved to where I've consider home, Beijing, when I was 6 years old. I attended the 
[Western Academy of Beijing (WAB)](https://www.wab-edu.cn/) for the majority of my pre-university education.
At WAB I ended up learning to love writing, history and politics in general, as well as
playing volleyball and football.
I also attended [人大附中](http://icc.rdfz.cn/sy/english/Welcome/xzzc/)
for two years during 7th and 8th grade, where the very Chinese teachers there were
surprised at how well I was able to write. For university, I went to the [School of Oriental and African Studiees](https://www.soas.ac.uk/)
in London, where I have a degree in east African politics. 

After university, I decided to make the most of my degree and start my 
career in marketing for South-East Asian tech companies. I started out at the
now acquired start-up TradeGecko. Afterwards, I joined Tickled Media as their 
Head of Marketing, doing work focused on their platform [TheAsianParent](https://sg.theasianparent.com/).
Finally, in 2016, I joined [Shopee Singapore](https://shopee.sg/) as a Marketing Lead, and 
eventually as the Head of Marketing Singapore. In 2019, I moved to Manila to lead the 
Marketing team for [Shopee Philippines](https://shopee.ph/). You may have seen a few
of the marketing campaigns that I've worked on, including [our rendition of Baby Shark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD1axEoK5rk),
[Blackpink's rendition of DDU-DU DDU-DU for Shopee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvhUiqvCsbM),
most recently, [Jackie Chan as a Shopee brand ambassador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TOyqCrT6b0),
and many many more. 

During the pandemic last year I moved back to Singapore and adopted our immunocompromised 
cat Eliza (Named after Eliza Schuyler from _Hamilton_). Since then, I've been based in Singapore. Beyond
Marketing in Shopee, I've recently also acquired the added responsibility of Head of Shopee Pay Online 
for Philippines, even though I'm trying my best to not work and retire early.
